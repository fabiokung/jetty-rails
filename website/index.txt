h2. What

See the "what is included":rdoc/files/History_txt.html in the last version.

Jetty Rails aims to run any Warbler based JRuby on Rails or JRuby Merb applications with Jetty Container, loading configuration from Warbler.

This project is useful for people developing JRuby on Rails (or Merb) applications that can not use mongrel for development. Rails and Merb applications integrated with servlet based applications in the same context would be a reasonable reason.

The project has born from my own needs ("read more":http://fabiokung.com/2008/05/14/jetty-rails-gem-simple-jruby-on-rails-development-with-servlet-containers/). I needed to run "JForum":http://jforum.net on the same context of my jruby on rails application. I had also to integrate @HttpSessions@ (avoiding single sign on) and use @ServletContext@ in-memory cache store.

h2. Installing

<pre>jruby -S gem install jetty-rails</pre>

h2. The basics

Jetty Rails uses Jetty Handlers to dispatch requests to the "JRuby Rack adapter":http://wiki.jruby.org/wiki/JRuby_Rack. 

All extra jars inside your application lib/ dir will be loaded. Things like Java @HttpSession@, @ServletContext@ and Runtime Pools are given by JRuby Rack Filter.

h2. Demonstration of usage

Rails:
<pre>
cd myrailsapp
jruby -S jetty_rails
</pre>

Merb:
<pre>
cd mymerbapp
jruby -S jetty_merb
</pre>
  
--help option shows usage details:
  
<pre>jruby -S jetty_rails --help</pre>
<pre>jruby -S jetty_merb --help</pre>

Please note that you may only use Merb with ActiveRecord, as DataMapper doesn't work in JRuby yet.

h2. Multiple Servers

You can specify a configuration yaml file rather than command line switches. 
The file also allows specifying multiple servers and / or application contexts for single jetty container. "Jetty Documentation":http://docs.codehaus.org/display/JETTY/How+to+serve+webbapp+A+from+portA+and+webapp+B+from+portB

For example, you could set a context_path of /testA on port 8888 which is rails, /testB also that port which is merb.
Or, you could have /testA on port 8888 and /testB on port 9999. 

<pre>jruby -S jetty_rails -c path/to/config.yml </pre>

The configuration options are inherited, so if you specify the environment to be "production" at the top level, 
then any servers and application context will be "production" unless the choose to override the value.

- server settings:

<pre>:port
:jruby_initial_runtimes
:jruby_max_runtimes
:thread_pool_max
:thread_pool_min
:acceptor_size</pre>

- application context settings:

<pre>:context_path
:base
:adapter
:environment
:lib_dir
:gem_path</pre>


As part of the configuration you have some control over jruby & jetty. Take a look at one complete config.yml from the examples bundled in jetty-rails:

<pre>
  --- 
  :servers: 
  - :context_path: /testA
    :base: jetty_rails_proj_2
    :adapter: :rails
    :environment: development
    :port: 2000
  - :context_path: /testB
    :adapter: :rails
    :base: jetty_rails_proj
    :environment: production
    :port: 3000
  - :port: 4000
    :apps:
    - :context_path: /testB
      :adapter: :rails
      :base: jetty_rails_proj
      :environment: development
    - :context_path: /testA
      :adapter: :rails
      :base: jetty_rails_proj_2
      :environment: production
  :environment: production
  :jruby_initial_runtimes: 1
  :jruby_max_runtimes: 2
  :thread_pool_max: 40
  :thread_pool_min: 1
  :acceptor_size: 20
</pre>

For more examples see:

  * spec/config.yml
  * spec/jetty_rails_sample_1.yml
  * spec/jetty_rails_sample_2.yml


h4. Rails:

If -c is not specified, by default jetty_rails will look for a @config/jetty_rails.yml@ relative to where it is started.

Don't forget to add this into your @config/environment.rb@
<pre>
ActionController::AbstractRequest.relative_url_root = "/testA"
</pre>

h3. JRuby Configuration

You can tweak the JRuby runtimes per application context:

<pre>
:jruby_initial_runtimes: 1
:jruby_max_runtimes: 2
</pre>

h3. Jetty Configuration

You can also modify the jetty per server configurations.

Thread pool will define the thread pool available to the jetty server using a @QueuedThreadPool@.

<pre>
:thread_pool_max: 40
:thread_pool_min: 1
</pre>

The acceptor size is the number of acceptor threads available for that server's channel connector.
<pre>
:acceptor_size: 20
</pre>
See the jetty documentation for more information.
